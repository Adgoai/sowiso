### How to Commit Changes to GitHub

3. Commit your changes with a message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
4. Push your changes to GitHub:

   If you see an error like:
   ```
   fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Adgoai/sowiso.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
   ```
   This usually means you do not have permission to push to the repository or your authentication has expired. Make sure you are logged in with the correct credentials or have access rights. You may need to set up a personal access token or SSH key. See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
